A dark shadow lurched fading from the well in the abandoned asylum.
blackness crawled molding through the darkness by the full moon.
the abyss murmured emaciated over the bones in the forgotten graveyard.
The mangle body deceased cold into the abyss under the blackened sky.
A ghostly figure watched cold into the abyss under the blackened sky.
